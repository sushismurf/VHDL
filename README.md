some essential VHDL modules written for Basys3 to make life less miserable for fellow Bilkent students.

feel free to use all modules as needed.

1. create a new Vivado project.
2. add the `.vhd` files to the design sources
3. Set up a constraints file (like `const.xdc`)
4. run synthesis, implementation, then generate bitstream.
5. Upload to board via USB JTAG.

you can find here [all shortcuts for Basys3](https://github.com/billypatty/VHDL/blob/main/Basys3Shortcuts.xdc) and a [UART code](https://github.com/billypatty/VHDL/blob/main/8bitUART.vhd) (unchanged from Mehmet Burak Aykenar's code). please also check out Mehmet Burak Aykenar's work. you can follow his [GitHub](https://github.com/mbaykenar) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mehmetburakaykenar) to support him.
